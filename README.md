# effission
Effission connects companies and employees by making it easy for corporations to track the impact of existing carbon emission mitigation programs. By involving employees in the process of choosing which causes to support, we hope to lay the groundwork for future partnerships and draw attention to an important (if not the most important) problem facing our society today. Finally, we make impact easy by providing a direct interface for carbon credit transfer through a one-click web platform.
